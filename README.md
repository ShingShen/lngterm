## ðŸ§  Command Reference

| Command     | Description                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `?`         | Show help menu                               |
| `exit`      | Exit CLI mode                                |

## Tasker YAML Format

The `tasker` feature allows you to automate command sequences via a YAML file. The YAML file should contain the device path, baudrate, and a list of commands to execute sequentially.

### Example `task.yml`

```yaml
commands:
  - "admin"
  - "password"
  - "ifconfig"
  - "ls"
```

The output will be logged to a file with a timestamp in the filename to avoid overwriting existing logs.


## ðŸ•“ Logging

- All logs are saved to files with the current timestamp in the filename.
- Log files are not overwritten on each run.

Example log filename:

```
log_2025-08-08_00-15-17.txt
```
